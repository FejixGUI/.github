# What is this
Fejix project was started with a strong wish to create a good GUI toolkit.
As it turned out, creating GUI toolkits is an extremely complex and nontrivial task, so I am going to develop only some tools for such a toolkit.

# What has been done so far

* I came up with a great idea of a good window nanagement library.
  At the moment, I am trying to implement it in the `fejix` repo.
